# Node_Cli

The following repo contains a CLI interface to interact with contract and also guides on how you can create your very own KOI_Task.

## Install

1. `git clone https://github.com/open-koi/node_cli.git`
2. Setup `.env`
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn start`

## TODO

- Setup KOI Tasks: If you select `Show KOI Tasks` to view the list of available tasks. Then you can enter the Id or name of any task which you want to run.The KOI associated with that task will get transferred to your wallet once the task is successfully completed and submitted to bundler(TODO: Need to combine this smart contract with original one).
